The main database for structural data is called PBD (Protein Data Bank). Let's see what it contains:

Data from: https://tinyurl.com/pdbtable

Read this into R
```{r}
library(readr)
pdbed <- read_csv("pdb_stats.csv")
pdbed
```
```{r}
pdbed$Total
```
I need to remove the comma and convert to numeric to do math
```{r}
as.numeric(sub(",", "",pdbed$Total))

```
I could turn this into a function to dic the whole table or any future table I read like this:
```{r}
x <- pdbed$Total
as.numeric(sub(",", "",x))

comma2numeric. <- function(x) {
  as.numeric(sub(",", "",x))
}
```

## Or try a different read/import function
```{r}
pdbed <- read_csv("pdb_stats.csv")
library(readr)
```
```{r}
pdbed$Total
```



**1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.**

```{r}
sum(pdbed$`X-ray`) / sum(pdbed$Total) * 100
```
```{r}
sum(pdbed$EM) / sum(pdbed$Total) * 100
```

**Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?**
```{r}
pdbed$Total[1]/sum(pdbed$Total) * 100
```

## Mol*
Mol* (pronouced "molstar") is a new web-based molecular viewer that we will beed to learn the basics of here
https://molstar.org/viewer/
We will use PDB code: 1HSG

**Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?**
In the current PDB, there are 226,414 HIV-1 protease structures.

**Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?**

We see one atom per water molecule in this structure because the hydrogens are too small to detect through crystallography sofrtware; therefore, only the oxygen atoms of the water molecule will be displayed in the structure. 

**Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?**

![Critical Water Molecule](1HSG_3.png)
The residue of the conserved water molecule is HOH 308.

**Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.**

Conserved water molecule is highlighted in green. ASP 25 residues are orange and teal.

## Introduction to Bio3D in R
The bio3d package allows us to do all sorts of structural bioinformatics work in R.

Lets start with how it can read these PDB files:

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

**Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? **

```{r}
sum(pdb$calpha)
```
OR
```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

**Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? **

HOH and MK1

**Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?** 
2 protein chains


```{r}
unique(pdb$atom$chain)
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Lets do bioinformatics predcition of functional motions - i.e. the movements that one of these moelcules meed to make to do its stuff.
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
# Perform flexibility 
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write our multimodel PDB file that we can use to make an animation of the predicted motions. 
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
I can open this in Molstar to play the trajectory animation. 



##Setup

**Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN?** 

I ran these cmds in the R brain/consule:
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("msa")

The `msa package` is found in BioConducter and not on CRAN.

**Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?:** 

The `bio3d-view package` is not found in BioConducter or CRAN.

**Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?** True

## Compartive Analysis of Protein Structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

Here we will find and analyze all ADK structures in the PDB database.

We will start with a single database accession trial.

```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```
**Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?**
There are 214 amino acids in this sequence. 

```{r}
ncol(aa$ali)
```


```{r}
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
#hits <- plot(b)
#head(hits$pdb.id)
```


Pre-calculated results:

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```


```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```


## Align and superpose structures
Next we will use the pdbaln() function to align and also optionally fit (i.e. superpose) the identified PDB structures.

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
pdbs
```

##PCA 
```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```
```{r}
plot(pc.xray, pc.axes = c(1,2))
```

## Optional further visualization
To visualize the major structural variations in the ensemble the function mktrj() can be used to generate a trajectory PDB file by interpolating along a give PC (eigenvector):
```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```

```{r}
uniprot <-248838887
pdb <- 195610

pdb/uniprot * 100
```
